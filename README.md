MSDS 431 Week 8

Assignment Requirements

Read the Gelman and Vehtari (2021) article and select one of the computer intensive statistical methods listed in that article: counterfactual causal inference, bootstrapping and simulation-based inference, overparameterized models, regularization, Bayesian multilevel models, generic algorithms, or adaptive decision analysis. It should be a statistical method that has been fully implemented in the R programming language.
Referring to the Comprehensive R Archive NetworkLinks to an external site., identify the R package(s) for the selected method and demonstrate an analysis in R. Name the method and show its web addresses (URLs).
Implement the selected statistical method in Go either by drawing on a third-party Go package or developing your own Go program.  Sites that may be of special value in responding to this discussion question are Awesome Go, and go.dev.
Employ Go testing, benchmarking, software profiling, and logging. What did you do to improve the performance of the Go implementation of the selected statistical method?
Compare the R and final Go implementations using the same input data. Ensure that results are comparable. Report on the memory requirements and processing times associated with the R and final Go implementations.
In the README.md file of the repository, describe your efforts in finding R and Go packages for the method. Review your process of building the Go implementation. Review your experiences with testing, benchmarking, software profiling, and logging.
Finally, in the READMe.md file, make a recommendation to the research consultancy. Under what circumstances would it make sense for the firm to use Go in place of R for the selected statistical method? Select a cloud provider of infrastructure as a service (IaS). Note the cloud costs for virtual machine (compute engine) services. What percentage of cloud computing costs might be saved with a move from R to Go?
